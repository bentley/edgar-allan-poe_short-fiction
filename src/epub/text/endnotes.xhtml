<p>Strictly speaking, there is but little similarity between
      the above sketchy trifle and the celebrated “Moon-Story” of Mr. Locke; but
      as both have the character of <i>hoaxes</i> (although the one is in a tone
      of banter, the other of downright earnest), and as both hoaxes are on the
      same subject, the moon—moreover, as both attempt to give
      plausibility by scientific detail—the author of “Hans Pfaall” thinks
      it necessary to say, in <i>self-defence,</i> that his own <i>jeu d’esprit</i>
      was published in the “Southern Literary Messenger” about three weeks
      before the commencement of Mr. L’s in the “New York Sun.” Fancying a
      likeness which, perhaps, does not exist, some of the New York papers
      copied “Hans Pfaall,” and collated it with the “Moon-Hoax,” by way of
      detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the other.</p>
<p>
      As many more persons were actually gulled by the “Moon-Hoax” than would be
      willing to acknowledge the fact, it may here afford some little amusement
      to show why no one should have been deceived-to point out those
      particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to establish
      its real character. Indeed, however rich the imagination displayed in this
      ingenious fiction, it wanted much of the force which might have been given
      it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy. That
      the public were misled, even for an instant, merely proves the gross
      ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an astronomical
      nature.</p>
<p>
      The moon’s distance from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000 miles. If
      we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens would bring the
      satellite (or any distant object), we, of course, have but to divide the
      distance by the magnifying or, more strictly, by the space-penetrating
      power of the glass. Mr. L. makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times. By
      this divide 240,000 (the moon’s real distance), and we have five miles and
      five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all could be seen so
      far; much less the minute points particularized in the story. Mr. L.
      speaks about Sir John Herschel’s perceiving flowers (the Papaver rheas,
      etc.), and even detecting the color and the shape of the eyes of small
      birds. Shortly before, too, he has himself observed that the lens would
      not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter;
      but even this, as I have said, is giving the glass by far too great power.
      It may be observed, in passing, that this prodigious glass is said to have
      been molded at the glasshouse of Messrs. Hartley and Grant, in Dumbarton;
      but Messrs. H. and G.‘s establishment had ceased operations for many years
      previous to the publication of the hoax.</p>

<p>
      On page 13, pamphlet edition, speaking of “a hairy veil” over the eyes of
      a species of bison, the author says: “It immediately occurred to the acute
      mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance to protect
      the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to
      which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically
      subjected.” But this cannot be thought a very “acute” observation of the
      Doctor’s. The inhabitants of our side of the moon have, evidently, no
      darkness at all, so there can be nothing of the “extremes” mentioned. In
      the absence of the sun they have a light from the earth equal to that of
      thirteen full unclouded moons.</p>
<p>
      The topography throughout, even when professing to accord with Blunt’s
      Lunar Chart, is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart,
      and even grossly at variance with itself. The points of the compass, too,
      are in inextricable confusion; the writer appearing to be ignorant that,
      on a lunar map, these are not in accordance with terrestrial points; the
      east being to the left, etc.</p>
<p>
      Deceived, perhaps, by the vague titles, Mare Nubium, Mare Tranquillitatis,
      Mare Faecunditatis, etc., given to the dark spots by former astronomers,
      Mr. L. has entered into details regarding oceans and other large bodies of
      water in the moon; whereas there is no astronomical point more positively
      ascertained than that no such bodies exist there. In examining the
      boundary between light and darkness (in the crescent or gibbous moon)
      where this boundary crosses any of the dark places, the line of division
      is found to be rough and jagged; but, were these dark places liquid, it
      would evidently be even.</p>
<p>
      The description of the wings of the man-bat, on page 21, is but a literal
      copy of Peter Wilkins’ account of the wings of his flying islanders. This
      simple fact should have induced suspicion, at least, it might be thought.</p>
<p>
      On page 23, we have the following: “What a prodigious influence must our
      thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an
      embryo in the womb of time, the passive subject of chemical affinity!”
       This is very fine; but it should be observed that no astronomer would have
      made such remark, especially to any journal of Science; for the earth, in
      the sense intended, is not only thirteen, but forty-nine times larger than
      the moon. A similar objection applies to the whole of the concluding
      pages, where, by way of introduction to some discoveries in Saturn, the
      philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy account of that
      planet—this to the “Edinburgh journal of Science!”
     </p>
<p>
      But there is one point, in particular, which should have betrayed the
      fiction. Let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals
      upon the moon’s surface—what would first arrest the attention of an
      observer from the earth? Certainly neither their shape, size, nor any
      other such peculiarity, so soon as their remarkable <i>situation</i>. They
      would appear to be walking, with heels up and head down, in the manner of
      flies on a ceiling. The <i>real</i> observer would have uttered an instant
      ejaculation of surprise (however prepared by previous knowledge) at the
      singularity of their position; the <i>fictitious</i> observer has not even
      mentioned the subject, but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such
      creatures, when it is demonstrable that he could have seen only the
      diameter of their heads!</p>
<p>
      It might as well be remarked, in conclusion, that the size, and
      particularly the powers of the man-bats (for example, their ability to fly
      in so rare an atmosphere—if, indeed, the moon have any), with most
      of the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence, are at
      variance, generally, with all analogical reasoning on these themes; and
      that analogy here will often amount to conclusive demonstration. It is,
      perhaps, scarcely necessary to add, that all the suggestions attributed to
      Brewster and Herschel, in the beginning of the article, about “a
      transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of vision,” etc.,
      etc., belong to that species of figurative writing which comes, most
      properly, under the denomination of rigmarole.</p>
<p>
      There is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the
      stars—a limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood. If,
      indeed, the casting of large lenses were all that is required, man’s
      ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task, and we might have them
      of any size demanded. But, unhappily, in proportion to the increase of
      size in the lens, and consequently of space-penetrating power, is the
      diminution of light from the object, by diffusion of its rays. And for
      this evil there is no remedy within human ability; for an object is seen
      by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself, whether direct or
      reflected. Thus the only “artificial” light which could avail Mr. Locke,
      would be some artificial light which he should be able to throw-not upon
      the “focal object of vision,” but upon the real object to be viewed-to
      wit: upon the moon. It has been easily calculated that, when the light
      proceeding from a star becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural
      light proceeding from the whole of the stars, in a clear and moonless
      night, then the star is no longer visible for any practical purpose.</p>
<p>
      The Earl of Ross’s telescope, lately constructed in England, has a <i>speculum</i>
      with a reflecting surface of 4,071 square inches; the Herschel telescope
      having one of only 1,811. The metal of the Earl of Ross’s is 6 feet
      diameter; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at the edges, and 5 at the centre. The
      weight is 3 tons. The focal length is 50 feet.</p>
<p>
      I have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book, whose
      title-page runs thus: “L’Homme dans la lvne ou le Voyage Chimerique fait
      au Monde de la Lvne, nouellement decouvert par Dominique Gonzales,
      Aduanturier Espagnol, autrem?t dit le Courier volant. Mis en notre
      langve par J. B. D. A. Paris, chez Francois Piot, pres la Fontaine de
      Saint Benoist. Et chez J. Goignard, au premier pilier de la grand’salle du
      Palais, proche les Consultations, MDCXLVII.” Pp. 76.</p>
<p>
      The writer professes to have translated his work from the English of one
      Mr. D’Avisson (Davidson?) although there is a terrible ambiguity in the
      statement. “J’ en ai eu,” says he “l’original de Monsieur D’Avisson,
      medecin des mieux versez qui soient aujourd’huy dans la cõnoissance
      des Belles Lettres, et sur tout de la Philosophic Naturelle. Je lui ai
      cette obligation entre les autres, de m’ auoir non seulement mis en main
      cc Livre en anglois, mais encore le Manuscrit du Sieur Thomas D’Anan,
      gentilhomme Eccossois, recommandable pour sa vertu, sur la version duquel
      j’ advoue que j’ ay tiré le plan de la mienne.”
     </p>
<p>
      After some irrelevant adventures, much in the manner of Gil Blas, and
      which occupy the first thirty pages, the author relates that, being ill
      during a sea voyage, the crew abandoned him, together with a negro
      servant, on the island of St. Helena. To increase the chances of obtaining
      food, the two separate, and live as far apart as possible. This brings
      about a training of birds, to serve the purpose of carrier-pigeons between
      them. By and by these are taught to carry parcels of some weight-and this
      weight is gradually increased. At length the idea is entertained of
      uniting the force of a great number of the birds, with a view to raising
      the author himself. A machine is contrived for the purpose, and we have a
      minute description of it, which is materially helped out by a steel
      engraving. Here we perceive the Signor Gonzales, with point ruffles and a
      huge periwig, seated astride something which resembles very closely a
      broomstick, and borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans <i>(ganzas)</i>
      who had strings reaching from their tails to the machine.</p>
<p>
      The main event detailed in the Signor’s narrative depends upon a very
      important fact, of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the
      end of the book. The <i>ganzas,</i> with whom he had become so familiar,
      were not really denizens of St. Helena, but of the moon. Thence it had
      been their custom, time out of mind, to migrate annually to some portion
      of the earth. In proper season, of course, they would return home; and the
      author, happening, one day, to require their services for a short voyage,
      is unexpectedly carried straight tip, and in a very brief period arrives
      at the satellite. Here he finds, among other odd things, that the people
      enjoy extreme happiness; that they have no <i>law;</i> that they die
      without pain; that they are from ten to thirty feet in height; that they
      live five thousand years; that they have an emperor called Irdonozur; and
      that they can jump sixty feet high, when, being out of the gravitating
      influence, they fly about with fans.</p>
<p>
      I cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general <i>philosophy</i> of the
      volume.</p>
    </li>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
“I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side of
the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it
the larger they seemed. I have also me and the earth. As to the
stars, <i>since there was no night where I was, they always had the same
appearance; not brilliant, as usual, but pale, and very nearly like the
moon of a morning. </i>But few of them were visible, and these ten times
larger (as well as I could judge) than they seem to the inhabitants
of the earth. The moon, which wanted two days of being full, was of a
terrible bigness.

 “I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side
of the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it
the larger they seemed. I have also to inform you that, whether it was
calm weather or stormy, I found myself <i>always immediately between the
moon and the earth.</i> I<i> </i>was convinced of this for two reasons-because
my birds always flew in a straight line; and because whenever we
attempted to rest, <i>we were carried insensibly around the globe of the
earth. </i>For I admit the opinion of Copernicus, who maintains that it
never ceases to revolve <i>from the east to the west, </i>not upon the poles
of the Equinoctial, commonly called the poles of the world, but upon
those of the Zodiac, a question of which I propose to speak more at
length here-after, when I shall have leisure to refresh my memory in
regard to the astrology which I learned at Salamanca when young, and
have since forgotten.”
 </pre>
<p>
      Notwithstanding the blunders italicized, the book is not without some
      claim to attention, as affording a naive specimen of the current
      astronomical notions of the time. One of these assumed, that the
      “gravitating power” extended but a short distance from the earth’s
      surface, and, accordingly, we find our voyager “carried insensibly around
      the globe,” etc.</p>
<p>
      There have been other “voyages to the moon,” but none of higher merit than
      the one just mentioned. That of Bergerac is utterly meaningless. In the
      third volume of the “American Quarterly Review” will be found quite an
      elaborate criticism upon a certain “journey” of the kind in question—a
      criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic most exposes
      the stupidity of the book, or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy. I
      forget the title of the work; but the <i>means</i> of the voyage are more
      deplorably ill conceived than are even the <i>ganzas</i> of our friend the
      Signor Gonzales. The adventurer, in digging the earth, happens to discover
      a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong attraction, and
      straightway constructs of it a box, which, when cast loose from its
      terrestrial fastenings, flies with him, forthwith, to the satellite. The
      “Flight of Thomas O’Rourke,” is a <i>jeu d’ esprit</i> not altogether
      contemptible, and has been translated into German. Thomas, the hero, was,
      in fact, the gamekeeper of an Irish peer, whose eccentricities gave rise
      to the tale. The “flight” is made on an eagle’s back, from Hungry Hill, a
      lofty mountain at the end of Bantry Bay.</p>
<p>
      In these various <i>brochures</i> the aim is always satirical; the theme
      being a description of Lunarian customs as compared with ours. In none is
      there any effort at <i>plausibility</i> in the details of the voyage
      itself. The writers seem, in each instance, to be utterly uninformed in
      respect to astronomy. In “Hans Pfaall” the design is original, inasmuch as
      regards an attempt at <i>verisimilitude,</i> in the application of
      scientific principles (so far as the whimsical nature of the subject would
      permit), to the actual passage between the earth and the moon.</p>

      clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were
      conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the moon, at the same
      elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent telescope,
      the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all times. From
      the circumstances of the observation, it is evident that the cause of this
      phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in the moon, or in the
      eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in something (an atmosphere?)

          <p>Upon the original publication of “Marie Roget,” the foot-notes now
      appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years since
      the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient to give
      them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design. A
      young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the vicinity of New York;
      and, although her death occasioned an intense and long-enduring
      excitement, the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period
      when the present paper was written and published (November, 1842). Herein,
      under pretence of relating the fate of a Parisian grisette, the author has
      followed in minute detail, the essential, while merely paralleling the
      inessential facts of the real murder of Mary Rogers. Thus all argument
      founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth: and the investigation
      of the truth was the object. The “Mystery of Marie Roget” was composed at
      a distance from the scene of the atrocity, and with no other means of
      investigation than the newspapers afforded. Thus much escaped the writer
      of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot, and
      visited the localities. It may not be improper to record, nevertheless,
      that the confessions of two persons, (one of them the Madame Deluc of the
      narrative) made, at different periods, long subsequent to the publication,
      confirmed, in full, not only the general conclusion, but absolutely all
      the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained. <a href="the-mystery-of-marie-roget.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

          <p>“A theory based on the qualities of an object, will prevent its
      being unfolded according to its objects; and he who arranges topics in
      reference to their causes, will cease to value them according to their
      results. Thus the jurisprudence of every nation will show that, when law
      becomes a science and a system, it ceases to be justice. The errors into

          <p><i>Note</i>.—Mr. Ainsworth has not attempted to account for
      this phenomenon, which, however, is quite susceptible of explanation. A
      line dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet, perpendicularly to the
      surface of the earth (or sea), would form the perpendicular of a
      right-angled triangle, of which the base would extend from the right angle
      to the horizon, and the hypothenuse from the horizon to the balloon. But
      the 25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing, in comparison with the
      extent of the prospect. In other words, the base and hypothenuse of the
      supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular,
      that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel. In this manner the
      horizon of the æronaut would appear to be <i>on a level</i> with
      the car. But, as the point immediately beneath him seems, and is, at a
      great distance below him, it seems, of course, also, at a great distance
      below the horizon. Hence the impression of <i>concavity</i>; and this
      impression must remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a
      proportion to the extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the
      base and hypothenuse disappears—when the earth’s real convexity must
      become apparent. <a href="the-balloon-hoax.xhtml#noteref-30" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

      and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with
      the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by
      four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the
      bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock,
      towering to a prodigious height. <a href="ms-found-in-a-bottle.xhtml#noteref-31" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
